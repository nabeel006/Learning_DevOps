It allows for wireless access to local area networks (LANs) and the internet, providing flexibility and mobility for users. Wi-Fi is commonly used in homes, offices, public spaces, and various other environments.

### Wireless Security Protocols:
This protect the network and its associated devices from unwanted access.
## Types:
## WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):
WEpis the oldest and most common Wi-Fi security protocol. It was the privacy component established in the IEEE 802.11,a set of technical standards that aimed to provide a wireless local area network (WLAN) with a comparable level of security to a wired local area network (LAN).

### WPA:
WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a wireless security protocol released in 2003 to address the growing vulnerabilities of its predecessor, WEP. The WPA Wi-Fi protocol is more secure than WEP, because it uses a 256-bit key for encryption, which is a major upgrade from the 64-bit and 128-bit keys used by the WEP system.

WPA also uses the _Temporal Key Integrity Protocol_ (TKIP), which dynamically generates a new key for each packet, or unit of data. TKIP is much more secure than the fixed-key system used by WEP.

### WPA2:
WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) is the second generation of the Wi-Fi Protected Access wireless security protocol. Like its predecessor, WPA2 was designed to secure and protect Wi-Fi networks. WPA2 ensures that data sent or received over your wireless network is encrypted, and only people with your network password have access to it.

A benefit of the WPA2 system was that it introduced the Advanced Encryption System (AES) to replace the more vulnerable TKIP system used in the original WPA protocol. Used by the US government to protect classified data, AES provides strong encryption.
